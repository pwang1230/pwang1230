### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at Stanford University. I obtained my M.S. in MS&E from Stanford and B.S. in Computer Science from Columbia. I am broadly interested in studying how immersive technology can augment interactions and facilitate collaborations. My current research focuses on developing algorithms and tools to understand and facilitate human behavior such as social interactions and the creative design process in immersive virtual environments.
