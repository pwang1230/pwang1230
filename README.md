### Hi there 👋

I am a PhD student at Stanford University. I obtained my M.S. in MS&E from Stanford and B.S. in Computer Science from Columbia. I am broadly interested in augmenting and modelling social interactions and user behaviors in digital contexts. My current research focuses on developing algorithms and tools to understand and facilitate human behavior such as social interactions and the creative design process in immersive virtual environments.
