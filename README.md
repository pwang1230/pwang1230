### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a first year Master's student at Stanford University. I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and minored in Applied Mathematics from Columbia. I am broadly interested in the intersection of Augmented and Virtual Reality, Art/Design, and the Social Sciences. My current research focuses on developing systems to facilitate social interactions in Virtual Reality.
