### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a first year Master's student at Stanford University. I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and minored in Applied Mathematics from Columbia. I am interested in Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Computer Vision and my current research focuses on how we can leverage AR/VR techniques to build task guidance systems and facilitate robot learning.
