### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fourth year undergraduate student at Columbia University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Applied Mathematics and Sociology. I am interested in Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Computer Vision and my current research focuses on how we can leverage AR/VR techniques to facilitate more efficient virtual assembly tasks and robot learning.
